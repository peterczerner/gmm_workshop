# GMM DIA Workshop January 2024

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is an example project to be used at GMM DIA workshop.

## RStudio account

To be able to run this project you need an
[RStudio](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/RStudio) Server account with R
release \> 4.1 (I have tested it using R4.3.2) and access to this github
repository. If you do not have such server access, you can get a free
account with [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/).

Please obtain RStudio access before the workshop!

## Create Project from Github

After you have logged into RStudion Server, you should create new
project as follows:

1.  Click drop down menu “New Project” on the left upper site of RStudio
    page.

2.  Chose “New Project from Git Repository”.

3.  Enter “<https://github.com/peterczerner/gmm_workshop>” as “URL of
    your Git Repository”.

4.  Click “OK”.

## Workshop

During the workshop we will go through the notepad `workshop.qmd`. Feel
free to browse through it in advance!
